This assignment is on Exceptions and the Adapter Pattern.  It is based on Example Two (whose source is found in Contents).

You need to create two new classes, InvalidDistanceComputationException and InvalidComparisonException.

*** NOTE *** Because you will throw these from overridden methods that ARE NOT declared to throw, you must inherit from RuntimeException so they are both unchecked exceptions. I did this intentionally because this overriding situation often arises in practice and inheriting from RuntimeException instead of Exception is the standard way of handling it.

I have given you the main() I will use and the expected output. You must modify the code of Example Two so it produces the output when run against the main() I have provided for this assignment. 

You will be adding throws where needed.
You will need to deal with the changes to the Scalable interface.
You must implement Square by using the Adapter pattern with the class Rectangle.
Equality for rectangles is defined by their areas being equal.
